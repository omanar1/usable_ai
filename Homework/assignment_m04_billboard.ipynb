    "# Homework 4 - Tidy and Process the Billboard Dataset\n",
    "The Billboard dataset comes with **76 columns** corresponding to the chart position of each song from `x1st.week` through `x76th.week`. This is a classic example of **wide** data that needs to be **melted** (unpivoted) into a long (tidy) format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "1. Follow the instructions on how to setup your Python and Jupyter (or VSCode) environment and cloning or downloading our repository. Instructions can be found in the class notes.\n",
    "2. Fill the missing pieces of code in the provided notebook.\n",
    "3. Run the notebook and make sure everything works.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Overview\n",
    "The dataset consists of songs and their weekly chart positions on the Billboard Hot 100. The dataset contains the following columns:\n",
    "- `year`: The year the song entered the chart.\n",
    "- `artist`: The artist of the song.\n",
    "- `track`: The title of the song.\n",
    "- `time`: The duration of the song.\n",
    "- `date.entered`: The date the song entered the chart.\n",
    "- `x1st.week` to `x76th.week`: The chart position of the song for each week.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load** the Billboard dataset from CSV.\n",
    "2. **Tidy** the data so each row represents one song in one week.\n",
    "3. **Calculate** the actual date for each week using `date.entered + week * 7 days`.\n",
    "4. **Split** the data into two tables:\n",
    "   - A **songs** table with static song information.\n",
    "   - A **positions** table with `(song_id, week, rank, date)`.\n",
    "5. **Save** the tidy data to **Feather** format in the same directory with `_tidy` suffix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- Submit your completed notebook as a HTML export, or a PDF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To export to HTML, if you are on Jupyter, select `File` > `Export Notebook As` > `HTML`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are on VSCode, you can use the `Jupyter: Export to HTML` command.\n",
    " - Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).\n",
    "     - Search for `Jupyter: Export to HTML`.\n",
    "     - Save the HTML file to your computer and submit it via Canvas.\n",
