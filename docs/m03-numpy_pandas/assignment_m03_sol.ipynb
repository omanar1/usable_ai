    "# Homework 2: Exploring Solar System Bodies (Pandas introduction)\n",
    "Welcome to Assignment 12!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will analyze data about celestial bodies in the solar system using Python, NumPy, and Pandas. The goals of this assignment are to:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Open a simple dataset formatted as JSON using pandas.\n",
    " - Apply simple statistical analysis to real-world data.\n",
    " - Refine Python programming skills through hands-on practice.\n",
    " - Ensure you can run Python and Python notebook environments (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, Collab, VSCode) and troubleshoot any setup issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key part of this homework is verifying that you can successfully run Python notebooks. If you encounter any difficulties, seek help from the instructor or AIs. Additionally, use Slack to ask questions or share insights. If you see a classmate struggling, helping them out will be great for a collaborative learning environment (and may count extra points in engagement ðŸ˜€)."

    "1. Follow the instructions on how to setup your Python and Jupyter (or VSCode) environment and cloning or downloading our repository. Instructions can be found in the class notes.\n",
    "2. Ensure that you have Python, Jupyter Notebook, and the necessary libraries installed (`NumPy` and `Pandas`).\n",
    "3. Load the dataset `Datasets/sol_data.json` into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "4. Answer the questions below by writing Python code.\n",
    "5. No plots or visualizations are requiredâ€”your insights should come from code-based analysis and outputs.\n",

    "### Dataset Overview\n",
    "The dataset contains information about celestial objects, including:\n",
    "- **isPlanet**: Indicates whether the object is a planet (`True` or `False`).\n",
    "- **isDwarfPlanet**: Indicates whether the object is a dwarf planet (`True` or `False`).\n",
    "- **orbit_type**: Classifies the object as \"Primary\" (planets) or \"Secondary\" (moons).\n",
    "- Physical and orbital properties, such as **mass**, **density**, **meanRadius**, **gravity**, **sideralOrbit**, and more.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Submission Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- Submit your completed notebook as a HTML export, or a PDF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To export to HTML, if you are on Jupyter, select `File` > `Export Notebook As` > `HTML`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are on VSCode, you can use the `Jupyter: Export to HTML` command.\n",
    " - Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).\n",
    "    - Search for `Jupyter: Export to HTML`.\n",
    "    - Save the HTML file to your computer and submit it via Canvas.\n",

Complete dates are formatted as `DD/MM/YYYY` (e.g, 12/04/1997), while years are formatted as `YYYY`, e.g., `1997`. Finally some dates may have `??` in place of day or months, which should be cleaned up. For instance by converting `??/??/1997` to `01/01/1997` or `??/04/1997` to `01/04/1997`. \n",

For example, first ignore NA values, then convert the valid complete dates while handling the years by padding them to a full date format if needed (like Jan 1st). Alternatively, you can use pd.period."
