    "# Homework 7 - Classification\n",
    "In this assignment, we will be applying some basic classification methods to the soccer database (found on canvas). We will first need to import all the libraries required for this guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "In this assignment, you will be performing the specified classification methods in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Load Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the following attributes from `Player_Attributes`:\n",
    "  - `gk_reflexes`\n",
    "  - `gk_kicking`\n",
    "  - `gk_handling`\n",
    "\n",
    "These values will be used for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Classification (Part 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `gk_reflexes` and `gk_kicking`.\n",
    "- Choose one of the attributes as the **target attribute**.\n",
    "- Generate **five classes** in the target property by reducing the range of values in the target data.\n",
    "- Split the data into **training** and **testing** sets.\n",
    "- Apply the following methods and print the resulting `accuracy_score` from `sklearn.metrics`:\n",
    "  - Logistic Regression\n",
    "  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
    "  - Decision Tree\n",
    "  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Classification (Part 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Repeat **Step 2**, this time using:\n",
    "  - `gk_kicking` and `gk_handling`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Again, print the corresponding `accuracy_score` for each classification method.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Analysis (Comment in Python file)\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following question as a **comment** in your Python file:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since this assignment (Classification) and the previous assignment (Regression) are with the same data, can you compare and conclude which technique is yielding best results?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Overview\n",
    "The dataset covers information about soccer players in sqlite format. This file is located in the `Datasets` directory of this repository. The file is called `fifa_soccer_dataset.sqlite.gz`. **This is the same file from the previous homework (assignment 4).**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't decompressed the file, you may need to follow the instructions below to decompress it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT** The database is compressed and needs to be decompressed before use. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal on Linux or MacOS:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "gunzip Datasets/fifa_soccer_dataset.sqlite.gz\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Windows, you can use the following command in your powershell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "$sourceFile = \"$PWD\\Datasets\\fifa_soccer_dataset.sqlite.gz\"\n",
    "$destinationFile = \"$PWD\\Datasets\\fifa_soccer_dataset.sqlite\"\n",
    "\n",
    "$inputStream = [System.IO.File]::OpenRead($sourceFile)\n",
    "$outputStream = [System.IO.File]::Create($destinationFile)\n",
    "$gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream($inputStream, [System.IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Decompress)\n",
    "$gzipStream.CopyTo($outputStream)\n",
    "\n",
    "$gzipStream.Close()\n",
    "$outputStream.Close()\n",
    "$inputStream.Close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can extract the file using the GUI of your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- Submit your completed notebook as a HTML export, or a PDF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To export to HTML, if you are on Jupyter, select `File` > `Export Notebook As` > `HTML`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are on VSCode, you can use the `Jupyter: Export to HTML` command.\n",
    " - Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).\n",
    "     - Search for `Jupyter: Export to HTML`.\n",
    "     - Save the HTML file to your computer and submit it via Canvas.\n",
